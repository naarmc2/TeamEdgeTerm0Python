                    <p>Consisting of a series of natural limestone pools, the Blue Hole is a hidden gem that captivates travelers with its azure waters. It offers quite the adventure: swim in the pools, go cliff-jumping, swing from ropes into the waters, explore a cave, and take a 10-minute hike to the Secret Falls. </p>
