    <h1><a href="https://codenext.withgoogle.com/">Code Next</a></h1>

    <p>
      Google's Code Next program works with high schoolers to cultivate the next
      generation of Black and Latinx tech leaders.
    </p>
    <h3>At Code Next, we challenge our engineers to:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Think</li>
      <li>Make</li>
      <li>Lead</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Think
    </h2>
    <p>
      Code Next students come into our physical labs after school and on the
      weekends to learn about computer science and problem solving. They become
      creative, computational thinkers.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Make
    </h2>
    <p>
      Students develop into confident, purposeful makers as they engage in both
      solo and team projects. They produce websites, programs, and other
      demonstrations of their learning and interests.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Lead
    </h2>
    <p>
      Through community relationships, mentor-mentee relationships with real
      Googlers, and leadership courses, Code Next students mature into effective
      and ethical leaders.
